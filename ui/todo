1. get chat client to work in ember, JS only.
  learn how broccoli works
2. add in notebook stuff to server and client; get that working over cable
3. bring in the rest of the starter kit, so we can have admin ui. 
4. Set up SSL server, sidekiq, everything we need for production api
5. Bring back end in. Maybe even bring in the existing front end?
6. Package it with thin, rpm
7. Refactor the backend to separate tasks from packages, allow many:many for tasks and packages, cadences and targets, etc.
8. Build new UI and connect up new API to serve it.



Thoughts on task-centric agile
  Should be able to easily indent to create subtasks; just like in text
  Should be able to bundle tasks
  Should be able to bundle bundles

  Decorate bundles with acceptance criteria, etc
  Relate bundles to each other (fixes_, depends_on, de_risks, learns_about, etc)
